This repo contains three packages.

**arm**

This package contains the urdf of the 6DOF arm.

**moveit_client**
This package invokes the moveit node to set the end effector to the required target position and orientation. This is where the IK is initiated.

colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON; source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch moveit_client client.launch.py;

**moveit_config**
This package was generated by the moveit setup assistant. It contains the config files for moveit.
 colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON;  source install/setup.bash;ros2 launch moveit_config demo.launch.py;

All the nodes are using system clock.

Current status is that when we run the client node, we can see the arm being moved to the target position on the rViz demonstrating IK.
